# Star Rating System - HTML & CSS

## Introduction

Welcome to the [**Star Rating System**](https://layakcoder.com/star-rating-system/) project! This is a simple yet powerful project built with **HTML** and **CSS** to create an interactive star rating system. Users can click on a star to rate, and the star will change color to yellow on hover, with a filled star on click. Additionally, an emoji will change according to the selected star rating, offering a fun and engaging experience for users.

### Key Features:
- **Star Rating System**: Users can rate from 1 to 5 stars by hovering and clicking on the stars.
- **Emoji Change**: The emoji above the stars changes dynamically based on the selected rating.
- **CSS Hover Effect**: The stars change color on hover, with smooth transitions to enhance the user experience.

This system is perfect for websites looking to gather feedback from users, whether for products, services, or general content ratings.

## How It Works

### HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
In the **HTML** structure, we create the layout for the star rating system. It involves:
- A parent `<div>` to contain the rating system.
- Multiple `<input>` tags to represent individual stars.
- Emoji containers placed above the stars to reflect the selected rating.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
We use **CSS** to create the visual effects:
- Stars change color to yellow on hover and remain filled when clicked.
- The emoji changes based on the number of stars selected, providing a dynamic user experience.
- Smooth transitions are applied for hover and click effects to ensure a polished interface.
